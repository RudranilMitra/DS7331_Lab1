This dataset was selected to model and predict used car prices and to classify price ranges by categories.  Included in the dataset were other types of vehicles such as buses and motorcycles.

For the regression problem of predicting car prices, RMSE along with k-fold cross validation will be used to determine the effectiveness of the prediction. For the classification problem, k-fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, True Positive Rate, and False Positive Rate will be used to measure the effectiveness of the prediction model. The value for 'k' in cross validation will be determined through hyperparameter tuning during the model building process."
